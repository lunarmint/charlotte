# Charlotte

Who else would archive Teyvat's cutscenes but its best journalist?

Charlotte is a Genshin Impact utility that losslessly decrypts `.usm` cutscene files into playable `.mkv` videos, covering all known cutscenes from versions 1.0 through 7.0. Charlotte is also able to retrieve keys directly from USM file itself, although an explicitly defined key is still preferred for processing speed.

This project is heavily inspired by [GI-cutscenes](https://github.com/ToaHartor/GI-cutscenes). Charlotte not only rebuilds the workflow at a higher level, it also has various optimizations to the decryption algorithm to be significantly more efficient (and even faster than the original implementation despite being on Python). Charlotte also add extras with tons of QoLs (see below), VapourSynth processing, and a GUI. Also credits to [UsmDiviner](https://github.com/Senkin219/UsmDiviner) for inspiring me with the key guessing algorithm.

If you have missing keys, pull requests are welcome.

Disclaimer: This tool is purely for educational purpose and aims to archive already released game content.

## Features

- Losslessly decrypt `.usm` into `.ivf` video and `.hca` EN, CN, JP, KR audio tracks
- Significantly improved decryption algorithm compared to GI-cutscenes implementation
- Key recovery for USM files without a key
- Convert `.hca` audio to lossless `.flac`, or `.opus` (VBR 256kbps) for smaller files
- Convert `.srt` subtitles into styled `.ass` in 15 languages with matching official cutscene subtitle style and fonts
- Mux all tracks into `.mkv`, with selectable default audio and subtitle tracks
- Automatically syncs the full subtitle collection (all 15 languages) from DimBreath
- Automatically fetches new keys from upstream
- Automatically get fonts from the game directory if possible
- VapourSynth pipeline for post-processing quality improvements
- Bundled lightweight custom FFmpeg build at only ~15MB
- Built-in updater that checks for a newer release and installs it in place
- Graphical User Interface (coming soon)

VapourSynth filter scripts take a lot of time to write to ensure quality, hence they will be slowly added over time. If you have encoding knowledge, contributions are welcome!

I should also mention that the VapourSynth filters are extremely heavy on CPU and GPU (to a lesser degree), so it's recommended to have a powerful machine for optimal performance.

## Quick Start (Windows Binary)

### Prerequisites

1. Download `charlotte.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/lunarmint/charlotte/releases/latest).
2. Locate `.usm` files at:
```
[Game Directory]\Genshin Impact game\GenshinImpact_Data\StreamingAssets\VideoAssets\StandaloneWindows64
```

Note: the availability of older cutscenes depends on your local game files and resource cleanup history.

### Usage

```sh
charlotte [PATHS...] [OPTIONS]
```

`PATHS` is one or more `.usm` files and/or directories containing `.usm` files.

Example:

```sh
charlotte "USM\Cs_Cutscene_Something_Girl.usm" -vs -nc
```

This decrypts the cutscene, applies the VapourSynth filter script, and writes to `output/Cs_EQHDJ005_HaiDengJie_Girl/Cs_EQHDJ005_HaiDengJie_Girl.mkv` without deleting intermediate files.

Process several files and/or directories at once:

```sh
charlotte "USM\Cs_A.usm" "USM\Cs_B.usm" "USM\Cs_More_Cutscenes.usm" -o output
```

To check what is available for your files (decryption key, local subtitles, VapourSynth script) without processing anything:

```sh
charlotte "USM\Cs_Cutscene_Something_Girl.usm" --probe
```

To recover key straight from the USM file and report them without demuxing or converting:

```sh
charlotte "USM\Cs_Cutscene_Something_Girl.usm" --crack
```

To check for a newer release, and install it in place after confirmation:

```sh
charlotte --update
```

For help:

```sh
charlotte --help
```

**Tip**: If you're running with `-vs` flag, for higher encoding speed, setting Python and FFmpeg in Task Manager to high priority can help. Alternatively, you can leave the terminal on the front so that Windows' Process Scheduling Priority will prioritize Charlotte.

| Option   | `--probe`                | `-p`      | Only report what is available for each file (decryption key, local subtitles, VapourSynth script). Read-only: nothing is processed or fetched. |
| Option   | `--crack`                | `-c`      | Recover key from USM file and report it, without demuxing or converting.                                                                       |

| Option   | `--update`               | `-u`      | Check GitHub for a newer release and update.                                                                                                   |

When neither `--crf`, `--preset`, nor `--x265-params` is set, the following x265 params are applied automatically:

```
keyint=300:min-keyint=30:no-open-gop=1:ref=6:bframes=8:lookahead-slices=0:rc-lookahead=60:aq-mode=3:aq-strength=0.75:qcomp=0.72:cbqpoffs=-2:crqpoffs=-2:no-cutree=1:rd=4:psy-rd=2.0:psy-rdoq=1.7:max-merge=5:no-strong-intra-smoothing=1:tskip=1:deblock=-2,-2:no-sao=1:no-sao-non-deblock=1
```

Setting `--crf` or `--preset` suppresses these params, letting x265 use its own defaults for everything else. To combine custom crf/preset with custom x265 params, use `--x265-params` explicitly (it always takes full precedence).

## Build From Source

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- FFmpeg (see below)

Install dependencies:
```sh
uv sync
```

Run the project:
```
uv run main.py USM/Cs_EQHDJ005_HaiDengJie_Boy.usm -vs -nc
```

For flag options, refer to the [Parameters](#parameters) section.

### Custom FFmpeg Build

The bundled `ffmpeg.exe` is a lightweight custom build. To rebuild it:

1. Set up [media-autobuild_suite](https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite).
2. Copy `ffmpeg_options.txt` from the repo root to `<suite>/build/ffmpeg_options.txt`.
3. To force a rebuild after changing options, delete `<suite>/local64/bin-video/ffmpeg.exe` before running `media-autobuild_suite.bat`.
4. Copy the resulting `<suite>/local64/bin-video/ffmpeg.exe` to the repo root.

If you don't want to do any of that, you can just get my prebuilt from [here](https://github.com/The-Steambird/charlotte/releases/tag/tools).

### Build Command

```sh
uv run pyinstaller charlotte.spec
```

## ❤️ Support

If you enjoyed using Charlotte, your support would mean so much to me. It keeps me motivated to invest more time into the project and keep it alive for as long as I can.
